# Materials

## Rationale for materials selection
The cornea has 5 distinct layers, all of which have their own specific composition. Of the 5 layers, 3 are cellularized and contribute most to the function of the cornea. The bottom most layer is the endothelium, composed mostly of collagen. The middle layer, which contributes to the bulk of corneal thickness, is the stroma. The stroma is also majorly composed of collagen. The main protein of the top layer, the epithelium, is keratin. An important function of the epithelium is to be at the air/liquid interface of the cornea, so the cells of this layer must have exposure to both air and the underlying hydrogel.

## Chemistry: composition, crosslinking mechanism (UV radical initiation) and kinetics

## Extrusion design/rate
- Extruder details (dimensions, components for each layer)
- Shear stress considerations

## GMP considerations
- Sterility: aseptic technique â€“ separate bioreactors, new material/swapping between nozzles
