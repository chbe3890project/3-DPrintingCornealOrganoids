# Materials

## Rationale for materials selection

## Chemistry (composition, crosslinking mechanism (UV radical initiation) and kinetics)

## Extrusion design/rate
- Extruder details (dimensions, components for each layer)
- Shear stress considerations

## GMP considerations
- Sterility: aseptic technique â€“ separate bioreactors, new material/swapping between nozzles
