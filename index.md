# Project Overview

## Summary
We designed a parsimonious bioprinting process to construct a packageable model of the human cornea that replicates the anatomy of this tissue system that is necessary for preclinical screening of ocular drug candidates. This process intensifies targeted culturing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs), differentiated into key cellular types of the corneal lamina, with sequential extrusion of these cells to form in vitro corneas with physiologically representative thickness of key layers. Herein, we believe our work represents an early opportunity to increase the quality of pharmacokinetic assessments of hits in the ophthalmic drug discovery space. Our use of 3D printing with tunable linear motion control, as well as our adoption of packageable approaches to cell management, support the reproducibility of the platform for which our goal is to demonstrate proof of concept. Therefore, our work also uses bioprinting in an attempt to address the central challenge of standardizing organoid technology.
