# Project Overview

## Summary
We designed a parsimonious bioprinting process to construct a packageable model of the human cornea that replicates the anatomy of this tissue system that is necessary for preclinical screening of ocular drug candidates. This process intensifies targeted culturing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs), differentiated into key cellular types of the corneal lamina, with sequential extrusion of these cells to form in vitro corneas with physiologically representative thickness of key layers. Herein, we believe our work represents an early opportunity to increase the quality of pharmacokinetic assessments of hits in the ophthalmic drug discovery space. Our use of 3D printing with tunable linear motion control, as well as our adoption of packageable approaches to cell management, support the reproducibility of the platform for which our goal is to demonstrate proof of concept. Therefore, our work also uses bioprinting in an attempt to address the central challenge of standardizing organoid technology.

## Significance
The ophthalmic drug development market is expected to reach $30.8B in revenue for fiscal year 2021, of which topically formulated agents are likely to retain 62% market revenue share. Of these agents, eye drops are projected to contribute 35% of market revenue share this year [1]. Therefore, the ophthalmic drug discovery space remains a lucrative opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in clinical candidate discovery. Enhanced approaches to hit discovery could improve both the quality and quantity of information on therapeutics for diseases of the eye, translating to increased probability of market breakthrough in these spaces. 

Therefore, we propose that the application of 3D models of the human cornea could more directly replicate human anatomy for characterization of therapeutic hits than the 2D, single-layer models presently employed in the ophthalmic drug development space [2]. The cornea is the first tissue layer that any ophthalmic drug contacts and is therefore critical to model in drug development, to characterize the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of potential therapeutics. Herein, more accurate models of drug interaction with the human cornea could allow for discovery of hits with higher potential for translation through clinical trials. Such 3D models would replicate the structurally and functionally diverse strata of the cornea displayed in the following image [3] far better than existing screening systems. We discuss the cellular and physiological profiles of these layers on the “Cells” and “Materials” sections of our website, respectively.
